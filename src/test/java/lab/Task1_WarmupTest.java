/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  TASK 1 – Warmup: Read and Understand Property-Based Tests  (20 min)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *  This file contains READY-TO-RUN property-based tests for StringUtils.
 *
 *  YOUR TASKS:
 *  1. Run all tests and verify they pass  (right-click → Run, or: mvn test)
 *  2. For each @Property method, read the code carefully and answer the
 *     questions in the comments above it.
 *  3. Add a @Report(Reporting.GENERATED) annotation to ONE property of
 *     your choice, re-run, and observe the generated inputs in the console.
 *
 *  DO NOT change the logic of the tests — only add annotations/comments.

     * QUESTION A: What does this property test?
     * Write your answer here (1–2 sentences):
     *
     * YOUR ANSWER:
     * It checks that countOccurrences is 0 when text and sub come from
     * different character sets, so sub cannot appear inside text.
     * 
     * QUESTION B: Why do we use two separate @CharRange annotations
     *             (one for 'text', another for 'sub')?
     * Write your answer here:
     *
     * YOUR ANSWER:
     * We use separate ranges to keep the generated characters disjoint.
     * That guarantees there cannot be any match.

     * QUESTION C: How does this property guarantee that the expected
     *             count is known before calling countOccurrences()?
     * Write your answer here:
     *
     * YOUR ANSWER:
     * Because text is built as sub repeated n times, we already know
     * the expected count must be exactly n.

     * QUESTION D: What is the name of the general PBT pattern used here?
     *             (Hint: it was covered in the lecture.)

     *
     * YOUR ANSWER:
     * By-construction generation.

     *             Explain why or why not.

     * No. This is a true rule for every string, so a correct reverse
     * method should always satisfy it.
